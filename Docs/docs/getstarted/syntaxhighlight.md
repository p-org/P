### Syntax Highlighting for P in Sublime

We used to support syntax highlighting for Sublime editor but is no longer maintained and hence may not support latest P language features. 
(But if you are die hard sublime fan check out: [Sublime Plugin for P (.p) files](https://github.com/p-org/Sublime-P)).

### Troubleshooting
If you face any issues getting the syntax highlighting working, please create an issue on the [P Github](https://github.com/p-org/P) Repository.
