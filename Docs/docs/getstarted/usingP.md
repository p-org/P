    Before moving forward, we assume that you have successfully installed the
    [P Compiler and Checker](install.md#step-3-install-p-compiler) and the [Syntax highlighting plugin](syntaxhighlight.md) :metal: .

We introduce the P language syntax and semantics in details in the
[Tutorials](../tutsoutline.md) and [Language Manual](../manualoutline.md). In this
section, we provide an overview of the steps involved in compiling and testing a P program
using the [client server](../tutorial/clientserver.md) example in Tutorials.


??? info "Get the Client Server Example Locally"  
    We will use the [ClientServer](https://github.com/p-org/P/tree/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer) example from Tutorial folder in P repository to describe the process of compiling and testing a P program. Please clone the P repo and navigate to the
    ClientServer example in Tutorial.

    Clone P Repo locally:
    ```shell 
    git clone https://github.com/p-org/P.git
    ```
    Navigate to the ClientServer examples folder:
    ```shell
    cd <P cloned folder>/Tutorial/1_ClientServer
    ```



### Compiling a P program

There are two ways of compiling a P program:

1. Using a **P project file** (`*.pproj`) to provides all the required inputs to the compiler or
2. Passing all the P files (`*.p`) along with other options (e.g., `-generate`) **as commandline arguments** to the compiler.

!!! tip "Recommentation"  
    We recommend using the P project files to compile a P program.

??? help "P Compiler commandline options:"
    The P compiler provides the following commandline options:

    ```shell
    ------------------------------------------ 
    Recommended usage: 
    
    >> pc -proj:<.pproj file>
    
    ------------------------------------------ 
    Optional usage: 
    
    >> pc file1.p [file2.p ...][options]
    
    options:
        -t:[target project name]   -- project name (as well as the generated file) if not supplied, use file1
        -outputDir:[path]          -- where to write the generated files
        -aspectOutputDir:[path]    -- where to write the generated aspectj files if not supplied, use outputDir
        -generate:[C,CSharp,RVM]   -- select a target language to generate
            C       : generate C code
            CSharp  : generate C# code
            RVM     : generate Monitor code
        -h, -help, --help          -- display this help message
    ------------------------------------------
    ```

    ??? info "P Project File Details"
        The P compiler does not support advanced project management features like separate compilation and dependency analysis (_coming soon_).
        The current project file interface is a simple mechanism to provide all the required inputs to the compiler in an XML format ([ClientServer.pproj](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/ClientServer.pproj)).
        ``` xml
        <!-- P Project file for the Client Server example -->
        <Project>
        <ProjectName>ClientServer</ProjectName>
        <InputFiles>
            <PFile>./PSrc/</PFile>
            <PFile>./PSpec/</PFile>
            <PFile>./PTst/</PFile>
        </InputFiles>
        <OutputDir>./PGenerated/</OutputDir>
        </Project>
        ```
        The `<InputFiles>` block provides all the P files that must be compiled together for this project. 
        In `<PFile>` one can either specify the path to a P file or to a folder and the P compiler includes all the `*.p` files in the folder during compilation.
        The `<ProjectName>` block provides the name for the project which is used as the output file name for the generated code.
        The `<OutputDir>` block provides the output directory for the generated code.
        Finally, the `<IncludeProject>` block provides a path to other P projects that must be included as dependencies during compilation. 
        The P compiler simply recursively copies all the P files in the dependency projects (transitively including all P files in dependent projects) and compiles them together. 
        This feature provides a way to split the P models for a large system into sub projects that can share models.

### Testing a P program

Compiling the ClientServer program generates a `ClientServer.dll`, this `dll` is
the C# representation of the P program. The P Checker takes as input this `dll` and
systematically explores behaviors of the program for the specified test case.

The path to the `dll` is present in the generated compilation output, check for line:
`ClientServer -> <Path>/ClientServer.dll`

You can get the list of test cases defined in the P program by passing the generated `dll`
to the P Checker:

```shell
pmc <Path>/ClientServer.dll
```

Expected Output:

```shell hl_lines="5 6 7"
pmc <Path>/ClientServer.dll

Provide /method or -m flag to qualify the test method name you wish to use. 
Possible options are::
PImplementation.tcSingleClient.Execute
PImplementation.tcMultipleClients.Execute
PImplementation.tcSingleClientAbstractServer.Execute
```
There are three test cases defined in the ClientServer P project and you can specify which
test case to run by using the `-m` or `/method` parameter along with the `-i` parameter to
specify how many different schedules to explore when running this test case (by default the checker explores a single schedule).
*For complex systems, running for 100,000 schedules typically finds most of the easy to find bugs before
running the checker on a distributed cluster to explore billions of schedules and rule out deep bugs in the system.*

So to run the `tcSingleClient` test case for 100 schedules, we can use the following command:

```
pmc <Path>/ClientServer.dll \
    -m PImplementation.tcSingleClient.Execute \
    -i 100
```

??? info "Expected Output"

    ```

There is a known bug in the ClientServer example (explained in the Tutorials) which is caught by
the `tcSingleClientAbstractServer` test case. Run command:
```
pmc <Path>/ClientServer.dll \
    -m PImplementation.tcSingleClientAbstractServer.Execute \
    -i 100
```

??? info "Expected Output"
    ``` hl_lines="9 11 12 15"

    . Testing <Path>/ClientServer.dll
    ... Method PImplementation.tcSingleClientAbstractServer.Execute

    ```

The P checker on finding a bug generates two artifacts (highlighted in the expected output above):
(1) a **textual trace file** (e.g., `ClientServer_0_0.txt`) that has the readable error trace representing the
sequence of steps from the intial state to the error state;
(2) a **schedule file** (e.g., `ClientServer_0_0.schedule`) that can be used to replay the error
trace and single step through the P program with the generated error trace for debugging
(more details about debugging P error traces: [here](../advanced/debuggingerror.md)).
