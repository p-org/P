    Before moving forward, we assume that you have successfully installed
    [P](install.md) and the [Syntax highlighting plugin](syntaxhighlight.md) :metal:.

We introduce the P language syntax and semantics in details in the
[Tutorials](../tutsoutline.md) and [Language Manual](../manualoutline.md). In this
section, we provide an overview of the steps involved in compiling and checking a P program
using the [client server](../tutorial/clientserver.md) example in Tutorials.


??? info "Get the Client Server Example Locally"  
    We will use the [ClientServer](https://github.com/p-org/P/tree/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer) example from Tutorial folder in P repository to describe the process of compiling and checking a P program. Please clone the P repo and navigate to the
    ClientServer example in Tutorial.

    Clone P Repo locally:
    ```shell 
    git clone https://github.com/p-org/P.git
    ```
    Navigate to the ClientServer examples folder:
    ```shell
    cd <P cloned folder>/Tutorial/1_ClientServer
    ```



### Compiling a P program

There are two ways of compiling a P program:

1. Using a **P project file** (`*.pproj`) to provide all the required inputs to the compiler or
2. Passing all the P files (`*.p`) along with other options **as commandline arguments** to the compiler.

!!! tip "Recommendation" 
    We recommend using the P project files to compile a P program.

??? help "P Compiler commandline options"
    The P compiler provides the following commandline options:

    ```
    -----------------------------------------------
    usage: p compile [--help] [--pproj string] [--pfiles string] [--projname string] [--outdir string] 

    The P compiler compiles all the P files in the project together and generates the executable that
    can be checked for correctness by the P checker.
    
    Compiling using `.pproj` file:
    ------------------------------
    -pp, --pproj string         : P project file to compile (*.pproj). If this option is not passed,
    the compiler searches for a *.pproj in the current folder
    
    Compiling P files directly through commandline:
    -----------------------------------------------
    -pf, --pfiles string        : List of P files to compile
    -pn, --projname string      : Project name for the compiled output
    -o, --outdir string         : Dump output to directory (absolute or relative path)
    
    Optional Arguments:
    -------------------
    -h, --help                  Show this help menu
    -----------------------------------------------
    ```

    `p compile` command searches for the `*.pproj` file in the current directory.

    If you are running `p compile` from outside the P project directory, use the `-pp <path to *.pproj>` option instead.

    ??? info "P Project File Details"
        The P compiler does not support advanced project management features like separate compilation and dependency analysis (_coming soon_).
        The current project file interface is a simple mechanism to provide all the required inputs to the compiler in an XML format ([ClientServer.pproj](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/ClientServer.pproj)).
        ``` xml
        <!-- P Project file for the Client Server example -->
        <Project>
        <ProjectName>ClientServer</ProjectName>
        <InputFiles>
            <PFile>./PSrc/</PFile>
            <PFile>./PSpec/</PFile>
            <PFile>./PTst/</PFile>
        </InputFiles>
        <OutputDir>./PGenerated/</OutputDir>
        </Project>
        ```
        The `<InputFiles>` block provides all the P files that must be compiled together for this project. 
        In `<PFile>` one can either specify the path to a P file or to a folder and the P compiler includes all the `*.p` files in the folder during compilation.
        The `<ProjectName>` block provides the name for the project which is used as the output file name for the generated code.
        The `<OutputDir>` block provides the output directory for the generated code.
        Finally, the `<IncludeProject>` block provides a path to other P projects that must be included as dependencies during compilation. 
        The P compiler simply recursively copies all the P files in the dependency projects (transitively including all P files in dependent projects) and compiles them together. 
        This feature provides a way to split the P models for a large system into sub projects that can share models.

### Checking a P program

Compiling the ClientServer program generates a `ClientServer.dll`, this `dll` is
the C# representation of the P program. The P Checker takes as input this `dll` and
systematically explores behaviors of the program for the specified test case.

The path to the `dll` is present in the generated compilation output, check for line:
`ClientServer -> <Path>/ClientServer.dll`

You can get the list of test cases defined in the P program by running the P Checker:

```shell
p check
```

!!! info "Expected Output"
    ```hl_lines="8 9 10"
    $ p check
    
    .. Searching for a P compiled file locally in the current folder
    .. Found a P compiled file: P/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PGenerated/CSharp/net6.0/ClientServer.dll
    .. Checking P/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PGenerated/CSharp/net6.0/ClientServer.dll
    Error: We found '3' test cases. Please provide a more precise name of the test case you wish to check using (--testcase | -tc).
    Possible options are:
    tcSingleClient
    tcMultipleClients
    tcAbstractServer
    
    ~~ [PTool]: Thanks for using P! ~~
    ```

`p check` command searches for the `*.dll` file in the current directory.

If you are running `p check` from outside the directory where `*.dll` is compiled to, run `p check <path to *.dll>` instead.

There are three test cases defined in the ClientServer P project, and you can specify which
test case to run by using the `-tc` or `--testcase` parameter along with the `-s` parameter to
specify how many different schedules to explore when running this test case (by default the checker explores a single schedule).
*For complex systems, running for 100,000 schedules typically finds most of the easy to find bugs before
running the checker on a distributed cluster to explore billions of schedules and rule out deep bugs in the system.*

So to run the `tcSingleClient` test case for 100 schedules, we can use the following command:

```shell
p check -tc tcSingleClient -s 100
```

??? info "Expected Output"
    ```
    $ p check -tc tcSingleClient -s 100

The P checker on finding a bug generates two artifacts (highlighted in the expected output above):

1. A **textual trace file** (e.g., `ClientServer_0_0.txt`) that has the readable error trace representing the
sequence of steps from the initial state to the error state;
2. A **schedule file** (e.g., `ClientServer_0_0.schedule`) that can be used to replay the error
trace and single step through the P program with the generated error trace for debugging
(more details about debugging P error traces: [here](../advanced/debuggingerror.md)).
