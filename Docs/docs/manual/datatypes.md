P Supports the following Data types:

- [Primitive](#primitive-data-types) data types: `int`, `bool`, `float`, `string`, and `enum`.
- [Record](#record-data-types) data types: `tuple` and `named tuple`. 
- [Collection](#collection-data-types) types: `map`, `sequence`, and `set`.
- [Foreign](#foreign-types) types: types that are not defined in P but in an external language (e.g., C# or Java) and can be used in the P program.
- Finally, [User Defined Types](#user-defined-types): user defined types that are constructed using any of the P Datatypes listed above.

Programmer can create user defined types using

### Primitive Data Types

### Record Data Types

### Collection Data Types

### Foreign Types

### User Defined Types
