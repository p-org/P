We start with a simple client-server example where clients send requests to withdraw money from a bank server. The bank server uses a backend database service to store the bank balance for its clients and on receiving a withdraw request updates the database and responds back to the client with the new balance in the account. In this example, there is not much complexity, there are multiple clients issueing withdraw requests concurrently and a single bank server that services these requests one-by-one. We will use this simple example to demonstrate how to implement such a systems as a collection of P state machines and also check correctness the property that the bank always responds with the correct bank balance for a client and a withdraw request always succeeds if there is enough balance in the account. We will also use P's capability to write multiple model checking scenarios and demonstrate how one replace components in P models with its abstraction.

!!! summary "Summary"
    In this example, you will learn about P state machines, writing simple safety and liveness specifications as P monitors, writing multiple model checking scenarios to check the correctness of the P program, and finally, replacing complex components in P with their abstractions using P's module system.
