P is a state machine based programming language for modeling and specifying complex
distributed systems. P allows programmers to model their system as a collection of
communicating state machines. P supports several backend analysis engines
(based on automated reasoning techniques like model
checking and symbolic execution) to check that the distributed system modeled in P
satisfy the desired correctness specifications. Not only can a P program be systematically
tested (e.g., model checking), but it can also be compiled into executable code.
Essentially, P unifies modeling, specifying, implementing, and testing into one activity for the
programmer.

P is currently being used extensively inside Amazon (AWS) for analysis of
complex distributed systems. P is also being used for programming safe robotics systems. P
was first used to implement and validate the USB device driver stack that ships with
Microsoft Windows 8 and Windows Phone.
