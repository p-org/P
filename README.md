P is a language for asynchronous event-driven programming. P allows the programmer to specify the system as a collection of interacting state machines, which communicate with each other using events. P unifies modeling and programming into one activity for the programmer. Not only can a P program be compiled into executable code, but it can also be validated using systematic testing. P has been used to implement and validate the USB device driver stack that ships with Microsoft Windows 8 and Windows Phone. P is also suitable for the design and implementation of networked, embedded, and distributed systems.

Manual
=========

Check the [P manual](https://p-org.github.io/P/).

Information for building P framework is available [here](https://github.com/p-org/P/wiki).

Demos
==========================================================
See [fun demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8ztpfMPs5c) using P to control a quadrocopter and make sense of the MavLink stream, all visualized in a live DGML diagram.

Application to Robotics
=========================================================
We built DRONA, a software framework for distributed mobile robotics systems. DRONA uses P language for implementing and model-checking the distributed robotics software stack (**[wiki](https://github.com/Drona-Org/Drona/wiki/Drona-Software-Stack)**). The C code generated from P compiler can be easily deployed on  Robot Operating System (ROS).
More details about the DRONA framework and simulation videos are available here:
**[https://drona-org.github.io/Drona/](https://drona-org.github.io/Drona/)**

We are working on using the DRONA framework for building real-world drone applications using **[PX4](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware)** and extending DRONA with runtime monitoring capabilities for reliability.
Details about these extensions will be posted soon.
