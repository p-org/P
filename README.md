P is a state machine based programming language for modeling and specifying complex distributed systems. P allows the programmer to specify the system as a collection of interacting state machines, which communicate with each other using events. P unifies modeling, specifying, implementing, and testing into one activity for the programmer. Not only can a P program be compiled into executable code, but it can also be systematically tested using Model Checking. 


P is currently being used extensively inside Amazon (AWS) for performing analysis of complex distributed systems.
P was used to implement and validate the USB device driver stack that ships with Microsoft Windows 8 and Windows Phone.
We have also used P for programming safe robotics systems.
