    * Action : closeConnectionOnFailure

Step 3:
    * Instruction: List all the files from the source server and move to the next step

Step 4:

        - If the status is success, then move to next step
    * Action : closeConnectionOnFailure

Step 9:
    * Instruction:
        - If all files from Step 3 have been successfully copied to target and deleted from source, proceed to next step
