Here is the basic P language guide:
<guide>
A P program consists of a collection of following top-level declarations:
1. Enums
2. User Defined Types
3. Events
4. State Machines
5. Specification Monitors
6. Global Functions
7. Module System

Here is the list of all words reserved by the P language. These words have a special meaning and purpose, and they cannot be used as identifiers for variables, enums, types, events, machines, function parameters, etc.:
<reserved_keywords>
var, type, enum, event, on, do, goto, data, send, announce, receive, case, raise, machine, state, hot, cold, start, spec, module, test, main, fun, observes, entry, exit, with, union, foreach, else, while, return, break, continue, ignore, defer, assert, print, new, sizeof, keys, values, choose, format, if, halt, this, as, to, in, default, Interface, true, false, int, bool, float, string, seq, map, set, any
</reserved_keywords>

<p_specific_restrictions>
1. DO NOT generate interface declarations in P files. P does not use standalone interface declarations.
2. Variable declarations: Use only "var name: type;" - NO inline initialization with =
3. Sequence operations: Use "seq += (index, value)" - NOT "seq += (value)"
4. Set operations: Use "set += (value)" for direct addition
5. Module definitions: Only reference existing/declared machines in module lists
</p_specific_restrictions>
