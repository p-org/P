This context file provides guidance for fixing common P language compilation errors. Keep these in mind to avoid compilation issues
1. Variable Declarations:
   CORRECT: var i: int; i = 0;
   WRONG: var i: int = 0;

2. Event Payload Access:
   CORRECT: Use function parameters to receive payloads
   state SomeState {
       entry (payload: PayloadType) { ... }
       on eEvent do (payload: PayloadType) { ... }
   }
   WRONG: var payload = receive(eEvent);

3. State Transitions:
   CORRECT: goto StateName;
   
4. Null Handling:
   CORRECT: if (variable != null) { ... }

COMMON ERRORS AND FIXES:

Error: "extraneous input 'receive' expecting..."
Fix: Remove receive() calls, use function parameters instead

Error: Variable declaration issues
Fix: Separate declaration and assignment

Error: Type mismatch
Fix: Add explicit type annotations

DEBUGGING INSTRUCTIONS:
- Maintain original program logic
- Fix syntax only
- Check for receive() calls first
- Ensure all variables declared with types
- Use parameter-based payload access
- Keep event-driven state machine structure intact
