Here is the P enums guide:
<P_enums_guide>
1. Enum values in P are considered as global constants and must have unique name.
2. If an enum is used in a user defined type declaration, the enum identifier cannot be a reserved keyword.

Syntax:: enum enumName { enumElemList }

Here is an example of enum declaration:
<enum_declaration_example>
// enum representing the response status for the withdraw request
enum tWithDrawRespStatus { WITHDRAW_SUCCESS, WITHDRAW_ERROR }

// User Defined Type
type tWithDrawResp = (status: tWithDrawRespStatus, accountId: int, balance: int, rId: int);
</enum_declaration_example>

Here is an example of enum declaration with values:
<enum_declaration_with_values_example>
enum tResponseStatus { ERROR = 500, SUCCESS = 200, TIMEOUT = 400; }

// usage of enums
var status: tResponseStatus;
status = ERROR;

// you can coerce an enum to int
assert (ERROR to int) == 500;
</enum_declaration_with_values_example>
