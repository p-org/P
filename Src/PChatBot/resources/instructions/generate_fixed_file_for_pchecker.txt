Based on your previous analysis and fix recommendations, generate the fixed P code only for files that require changes.
For each file that needs fixing:
1. Apply the recommended fixes
2. Identify and apply any necessary consequential changes required to maintain the functionality
3. Ensure the complete fixed code is valid

Here is the original p code of all p files in the project. The code for each file is enclosed in its filename xml tags:
{p_code}

Your recommended fixes:
{fix_description}

Please
1. Fix the error in the necessary file
2. Identify ALL other files that would need modifications as a result of this change
3. Provide complete updated versions of each affected file
4. Enclose each modified file in XML tags using the filename as the tag name. Don't generate any additional response or text.
