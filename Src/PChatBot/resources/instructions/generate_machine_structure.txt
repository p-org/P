Write the structure of P code for the state machine {machineName}. Include all variable declarations, state declarations, event handlers, and function declarations, BUT leave all function bodies empty (with just placeholder comments). Ensure that the components in <components></components> tags and the interactions in <interactions></interactions> tags are reflected in the structure. The structure should include:

1. Machine declaration with local variable declarations
2. All states with their annotations (start, hot, cold)
3. Entry and exit function references within states
4. Event handlers (on-do and on-goto statements)
5. Defer and ignore statements
6. Function declarations with proper parameters and return types, but EMPTY bodies, do add COMMENTS for future stages of code generation.

Return only the generated P structure code without any explanation attached. Return the P code enclosed in XML tags where the tag name is "structure".
