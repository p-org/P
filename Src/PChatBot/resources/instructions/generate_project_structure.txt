Create the project directory structure for the P project named {project_name}. 

1. Create the three main directories:
   - PSrc: Source code for P state machines
   - PSpec: Specification monitors
   - PTst: Test cases

2. Create a .pproj file in the project root directory with proper XML configuration:
   - ProjectName: {project_name}
   - InputFiles: References to PSrc, PSpec, and PTst directories
   - OutputDir: Directory for generated code (PGenerated)

Create all necessary directories and the .pproj file according to P language project standards.
