Carefully read the following standard operating procedure (SOP) and ensure you understand the correct order of actions performed to complete the task.

<standard_operating_procedure>
{sop_content}
</standard_operating_procedure>

Now, review the following list of the actions. Pay attention to the input and output of each action, as they are essential for determining the next action to take
<action_types>
{actions_content}
</action_types>


Now, carefully considering the instructions in standard operating procedure and action types, generate only one P specification that ensures that the actions are performed in the correct order.
- Start by generating the necessary types for payloads and return types of actions
- Generate events for the actions listed in the <action_types></action_types> tags
- Add necessary assertions to validate all the decision points in this SOP
- Add assertions to catch if the system performs any action that deviates from the order given in this SOP

Generate only P specification code and return the P code enclosed in XML tags where the tag name is the filename. P tests and P source implementation are not needed. Verify that the generated code strictly follows all the P syntax rules before considering it final.
