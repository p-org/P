Write P code for the {filename} file. Ensure that the test scenarios specified in <possible_scenarios></possible_scenarios> tags are implemented. Always create all dependent machines before initializing machines that will send events/messages to them; never use default/null machine references in initialization. Verify that the generated code strictly follows all the P syntax rules before considering it final. Return only the generated P code without any explanation attached. Return the P code enclosed in XML tags where the tag name is the filename.
