You are tasked with checking P language code files for compliance with critical compilation rules and making necessary corrections. Follow these steps carefully:

REQUIRED CONTEXT
Before performing any checks, you must have access to:
1. The Enums_Types_Events.p file content - This contains all core declarations
2. List of machine names in the project
3. Any other existing P files that may contain relevant declarations

1. EVENT DECLARATIONS CHECK
- First analyze Enums_Types_Events.p to understand existing declarations
- Cross-reference with machine names to understand the system structure
- Scan the target file for event declarations and usage
- Verify that every event used is either:
  * Declared in Enums_Types_Events.p, or
  * Properly declared within the current file
- Check for duplicate declarations against Enums_Types_Events.p
- If an event is used but not declared anywhere, add its declaration to Enums_Types_Events.p

2. TYPE DEFINITIONS CHECK
- First analyze Enums_Types_Events.p for existing type definitions
- Create a dependency graph of type usage in the current file
- For each type reference:
  * Check if it's defined in Enums_Types_Events.p
  * If not, verify it's defined in the current file before usage
  * For types defined in the current file:
    - Ensure they appear before their first usage
    - Check for conflicts with types in Enums_Types_Events.p
    - Move definitions earlier if needed

3. VARIABLE DECLARATIONS CHECK
- For each function and state in the code:
  * Identify ALL variable declarations, including those in:
    - Function bodies
    - Loop bodies (while, foreach)
    - Conditional blocks (if/else)
    - State entry blocks
  * Move ALL declarations to the beginning of their enclosing scope
  * For variables used in loops or conditionals:
    - Move the declaration outside and before the block
    - Example:
      ```
      // INCORRECT:
      while (i < count) {
        var temp: int;
        // ...
      }
      
      // CORRECT:
      var temp: int;
      while (i < count) {
        // ...
      }
      ```
  * Maintain declaration order when moving variables
  * Ensure all variables are declared before any executable statements
  * Special attention to machine-level variables:
    - Should be declared at the top of the machine, before any states or functions
    - Example:
      ```
      machine TestMachine {
        var client: Client;      // Machine-level variable
        var count: int;          // Machine-level variable
        
        start state Init {
          var temp: int;         // State-level variable
          entry Init_Entry { ... }
        }
      }
      ```

4. SET AND SEQUENCE OPERATIONS CHECK
- Search for any use of += operator with sets and sequences
- For sets, replace += operations with proper set union syntax:
  * Instead of: set += element
  * Use: set = set + (element)
  * Example: resourcesLocked = resourcesLocked + (resourceId)
- For sequences, use proper sequence append syntax:
  * Instead of: seq += element
  * Use: seq = seq + (element,)
  * The comma is required in the tuple for sequence append
  * Example: result = result + (elem,)

5. VARIABLE INITIALIZATION CHECK
- Ensure all set and sequence variables are properly initialized before use
- Set initialization: var = {}
- Sequence initialization: var = default(seq[type])
- Initialize at declaration, not after other statements
- Example:
  ```
  var resourcesLocked: set[int] = {};
  var pendingLockRequests: set[int] = {};
  ```

6. TYPE COMPATIBILITY CHECK
- Check operations between different types:
  * Set operations must be between same set types
  * Cannot directly convert between set and sequence
  * When using set elements in sequence, convert properly:
    - Use helper functions like SetToSeq for conversion
    - Ensure return types match expected types
  * Example:
    ```
    fun SetToSeq(s: set[int]) : seq[int] {
      var result: seq[int];
      foreach (elem in s) {
        result = result + (elem,);
      }
      return result;
    }
    ```

7. VARIABLE SCOPE CHECK
- Declare all variables at the start of their scope
- Move any var declarations found mid-function to the top
- Ensure variables used in foreach loops are properly declared
- Example:
  ```
  fun ProcessNextInQueue(resourceId: int) {
    var nextClient: machine;
    var nextClientId: int;
    var i: int;
    var newQueue: seq[machine];
    // Rest of function...
  }
  ```

CORRECTION PROCESS:
1. First scan the entire file to identify all issues
2. Create a list of required changes
3. Make changes in this order:
   - Type definitions (to ensure dependencies are correct)
   - Event declarations
   - Variable declarations and initializations
   - Set and sequence operations
   - Type compatibility issues
   - Variable scope fixes
4. For each change:
   - Ensure the syntax matches P language requirements exactly
   - Verify type compatibility
   - Check variable scoping and initialization
   - Maintain proper tuple syntax (e.g., (elem,) for sequences)
5. After changes:
   - Verify all variables are declared at scope start
   - Check all set/sequence operations use proper syntax
   - Ensure type compatibility across operations
   - Validate helper functions for type conversions
6. Maintain original code formatting and comments

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Preserve all existing functionality while making syntax corrections
- Keep all comments and documentation intact
- Maintain consistent indentation and code style
- If multiple solutions are possible, choose the one that requires minimal code changes
- Document all changes made in comments for traceability

OUTPUT FORMAT:
For each file modified, provide:
1. List of issues found
2. Changes made to resolve each issue
3. Before/after code snippets for significant changes
4. Verification that no new issues were introduced
