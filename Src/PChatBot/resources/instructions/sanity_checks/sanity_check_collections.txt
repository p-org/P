You are tasked with checking P language code files for COLLECTION OPERATIONS compliance. Follow these steps:

COLLECTION OPERATIONS CHECK:
- CRITICAL: P does NOT support these operations:
  * NO append() function exists - use seq = seq + (element,)
  * NO inline initialization like var seq: seq[int] = {};

- Sequence Operations in P:
  ```p
  var seq: seq[T];
  var x: T, i: int;

  // CORRECT - Add element x at index i
  seq += (i, x);

  // CORRECT - Add element to end of sequence
  seq += (sizeof(seq), x);

  // WRONG - These are not supported:
  seq = seq + (x,);           // Wrong: Cannot concatenate with tuple
  seq = append(seq, x);       // Wrong: No append function
  seq = seq + default(seq[T]) + (x,);  // Wrong: Cannot concatenate sequences
  ```

CORRECT COLLECTION SYNTAX:
- Sequence operations: `seq + (elem,)`, `seq += (index, elem)`
- Set operations: `set + (elem)`, `set - (elem)`
- Map operations: `map + (key, value)`, `map - (key)`

CORRECTION PROCESS:
1. Scan the entire file to identify collection operation issues
2. Create a list of required changes for collections only
3. Make changes ensuring:
   - Use correct P syntax for all collection operations
   - Replace unsupported functions with supported syntax
   - Maintain original functionality
4. Verify all collection operations compile correctly

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return only the corrected P code with collection operation fixes applied.
Return the P code enclosed in XML tags where the tag name is the filename.
