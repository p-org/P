You are tasked with checking P language code files for DUPLICATE DECLARATIONS compliance. Follow these steps:

DUPLICATE DECLARATION CHECK:
- Scan across ALL files for duplicate declarations
- Check for duplicate spec/monitor names across PSpec files
- Common error: Same spec declared in multiple files
- Check for duplicate:
  * Event declarations
  * Type definitions
  * Machine names
  * Function names
  * Spec/Monitor names

CORRECTION PROCESS:
1. Scan the entire file and compare with Enums_Types_Events.p
2. Identify all duplicate declarations
3. Create a list of required changes for duplicates only
4. Make changes by either:
   - Removing duplicate declarations
   - Renaming conflicting declarations
   - Moving declarations to appropriate files
5. Ensure no functionality is lost during duplicate removal

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return only the corrected P code with duplicate declaration fixes applied.
Return the P code enclosed in XML tags where the tag name is the filename.
