You are tasked with checking P language code files for EVENT DECLARATIONS compliance. Follow these steps:

EVENT DECLARATIONS CHECK:
- Analyze Enums_Types_Events.p to understand existing declarations
- Cross-reference with machine names to understand the system structure
- Scan the target file for event declarations and usage
- Module definitions: Only reference existing/declared machines in module lists
- DO NOT DEFINE ANY NEW MACHINES OR SPECS OR TESTS IN modules
- Verify that every event used is either:
  * Declared in Enums_Types_Events.p, or in any other available files in the context or
  * Properly declared within the current file
- Check for duplicate declarations against Enums_Types_Events.p
- If an event is used but not declared anywhere, add its declaration to the current file

CORRECTION PROCESS:
1. Scan the entire file to identify event declaration issues
2. Create a list of required changes for events only
3. Make changes ensuring:
   - All events are properly declared before use
   - No duplicate declarations exist
   - Module definitions only reference existing machines
4. Verify all event references have corresponding declarations

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return only the corrected P code with event declaration fixes applied.
Return the P code enclosed in XML tags where the tag name is the filename.
