You are tasked with checking P language code files for TYPE DEFINITIONS compliance. Follow these steps:

TYPE DEFINITIONS CHECK:
- Analyze Enums_Types_Events.p for existing type definitions
- Create a dependency graph of type usage in the current file
- For each type reference:
  * Check if it's defined in Enums_Types_Events.p
  * If not, verify it's defined in the current file before usage
  * For types defined in the current file:
    - Ensure the types appear before their first usage
    - Check for conflicts with types in Enums_Types_Events.p
    - Move definitions earlier if needed

TYPE COMPATIBILITY CHECK:
- Check operations between different types:
  * Set operations must be between same set types
  * Cannot directly convert between set and sequence
  * Sequence element types must match exactly
  * When using set elements in sequence, convert properly:
    - Use helper functions like SetToSeq for conversion
    - Ensure return types match expected types
  * Example:
    ```p
    fun SetToSeq(s: set[int]) : seq[int] {
      var result: seq[int];
      foreach (elem in s) {
        result = result + (elem,);
      }
      return result;
    }
    ```

CORRECTION PROCESS:
1. Scan the entire file to identify type definition and compatibility issues
2. Create a list of required changes for types only
3. Make changes ensuring:
   - Type definitions appear before usage
   - No type conflicts exist
   - Type compatibility is maintained across operations
4. Add helper functions for type conversions if needed

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return only the corrected P code with type definition fixes applied.
Return the P code enclosed in XML tags where the tag name is the filename.
