Here is the original p code of all p files in the project. The code for each file is enclosed in its filename xml tags:
{p_code}

Based on the following analysis and fix recommendations, generate the fixed P code only for files that require changes.
{fix_description}

Output guide:
1. Fix the error in the necessary file
2. Identify ALL other files that would need modifications as a result of this change
3. ONLY provide patches for the files in the unified diff format. Here is an example of a patch:

```

4. Respond ONLY in unified diff format, no talking.
