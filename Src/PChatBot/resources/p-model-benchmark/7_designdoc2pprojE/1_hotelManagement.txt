<title> Hotel Management Application </title>

<introduction>
The goal of this system is to develop a hotel service booking application that enables the front desk to handle client requests, including room reservations, special requests, and cancellations. The application will maintain a centralized database to record room bookings and prevent double booking of rooms.
</introduction>

<components>

1. Front Desk
* Manages client requests, including room reservations, special requests, and cancellations.
* Keeps track of room availability and existing reservations.
* Communicates with clients regarding their requests and reservations.

2. Client

* Submits special requests (e.g., preferences for room placement).
* Cancels room reservations.
* Waits for responses from the front desk.
* May make additional requests based on responses received.

1. RoomReservationRequest
* Source: Client sending the request
* Target: Front Desk
* Payload: Client, Client id, Client name
* Description: A client requests a room. If successful, the client is assigned a room. If unsuccessful, the client is informed of the failure.
* Effects:
    * If a room is available, the front desk assigns it to the client and provides the room number.
    * If no rooms are available, the front desk informs the client of the inability to reserve a room.

2. CancellationRequest
* Source: Client sending the request
* Target: Front Desk
* Payload: Client, Client id, Client name, room number
* Description: A client requests to cancel their reservation. The request is processed if the client’s name matches the reservation for the given room. If it does not match, the request is rejected.
* Effects:
    * If the client’s name matches the reservation, the room is freed up, and the client is notified of successful cancellation.
    * If the client’s name does not match the reservation, the cancellation is rejected, and the client is informed.

3. SpecialRequest
* Source: Client sending the request
* Target: Front Desk
* Payload: Client, Client id, Client name, room number, and special request details
* Description: A client with an existing reservation submits a special request. The request is recorded if the client is staying in the room mentioned. Otherwise, the request is discarded.
* Effects:
    * If the client’s name matches the reservation for the specified room, the request is noted, and the client is informed of its successful recording.
    * If the client’s name does not match the reservation, the request is discarded, and the client is informed.
