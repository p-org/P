<title> Light Control System </title>

<introduction>
The Light Control System enables users to control multiple lights through dedicated switches. Each switch is paired with a specific light, allowing users to turn lights on and off while maintaining accurate status information about each light's current state. The system ensures reliable control and feedback for multiple light-switch pairs operating simultaneously.
</introduction>

<components>

1. Switch
* Controls a single designated light
* Has a unique identifier
* Flips the current state of the light to ON/OFF
* Key responsibilities:
    * Sending requests to flip its light's state
    * Tracking the current state of the light

2. Light
* Can be either On or Off
* Responds to toggle requests from a switch
* Informs the switch of its state after being toggled
* Can be controlled by multiple different switches
* Key responsibilities:
    * Changing its state when requested
    * Informing its switch about state changes
    * Maintaining its current state

</components>

<interactions>

1. Toggle Request
* Source: Switch making the request
* Target: Associated light
* Description: Request to change a light's state from On to Off or Off to On
* Effects:
    * The light changes its state
    * The switch receives confirmation of the change

2. Status Update
* Source: Light that changed state
* Target: Switch that requested the change
* Description: Informs the switch of the light's new state
* Effects:
    * The switch updates its display of the light's status
    * Users can see the current state of the light

</interactions>

<global_specifications>

1. Each switch controls exactly one light.
2. Each switch has a unique identifier to avoid confusion.
3. Lights can only be in one of two states: On or Off.
4. The system always maintains accurate information about each light's state.
5. Multiple switch-light pairs can operate independently.

</global_specifications>

<possible_scenarios>

1. A user toggles a light that is currently off, turning it on.
2. A user toggles a light that is currently on, turning it off.
3. Multiple users operate different switches for the same light at the same time.
