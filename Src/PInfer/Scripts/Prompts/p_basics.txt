Here is the basic P language guide:
<guide>
A P program consists of a collection of following top-level declarations:
1. Enums
2. User Defined Types
3. Events
4. State Machines
5. Specification Monitors
6. Global Functions
7. Module System
</guide>

Here is the P events guide:
<P_events_guide>
1. A P program is a collection of state machines communicating with each other by exchanging events.
2. An event in P has two parts: an event name and a payload value (optional) that can be sent along with the event.

Here is a correct example of events:
<events_example>
// declarations of events with no payloads
event ePing;
event ePong;

// declaration of events that have payloads
type tRequest = (client: machine, requestId: int, key: string);
// eRequest event with payload of user defined type tRequest
event eRequest: tRequest;

type tWriteTransResp = (transId: int, status: tTransStatus);
// eWriteTransResp event with payload of user defined type tWriteTransResp
event eWriteTransResp : tWriteTransResp;
</events_example>
