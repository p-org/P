# PSym

[![PSym on Ubuntu](https://github.com/p-org/P/actions/workflows/psym.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/p-org/P/actions/workflows/psym.yml)

The basic idea behind PSym is to perform symbolic exploration of P models, powered by automated reasoning through Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) or SAT/SMT solvers.

PSym is composed of two components: 
  1) [Compiler backend](../../PCompiler/CompilerCore/Backend/Symbolic) in C# that converts a P model to a customized symbolically-instrumented Java code.
  2) [Runtime analysis](../PSymRuntime) in Java that performs systematic symbolic exploration by executing the symbolically-instrumented Java code.

## Installing PSym
Run: `` ./scripts/build.sh ``

This installs PSym with the default BDD backend. For detailed solver options, check [SOLVERS.md](SOLVERS.md)

## Running PSym

### Usage

     ./scripts/run_psym.sh <path-to-P-project> <project-name> <args> 

### Example
    
    ./scripts/run_psym.sh Examples/tests/PingPong/ psymExample 

### Output
PSym creates a directory `` output/<project-name> `` which contains results, statistics and logs relating to the run.

    output
