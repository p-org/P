# P Model Checker Portfolio Runner

P Model Checker supports several backends and search strategies to explore the state space of the system. There is no one strategy that works best across -- bug-finding, or better coverage, or for proof (exhaustive search). Hence, the portfolio runner provides a simple script to run all the different search techniques to the best results for bug-finding, state-space coverage, and exhaustive search for proof.

Let's get started with the Portfolio Runner. The portfolio runner runs the P checker in parallel.

## Prerequisites
&nbsp;
### Install P
Follow the installation steps on https://p-org.github.io/P/getstarted/install/


&nbsp;
### Portfolio Configuration File

First, you will need to add a configuration file named `portfolio-config.json` in your P project directory. This file will  contain the needed information to configure the portfolio run.
    
Note that `portfolio-config.json` should be present at the top level of the P project directory, i.e., same directory as `<project-name>.pproj` file.

Checkout an example `portfolio-config.json` file [here](../../../Tutorial/1_ClientServer/portfolio-config.json).

The following parameters are currently supported in `portfolio-config.json`:

|   **Parameter**    | **Description**                                                                     |                            **Recommended**                            |

## Running Portfolio Checker

Simply run the portfolio runner `pmc.py` script directly as:
```bash
python3 pmc.py -p <local-project-path>
```
where `<local-project-path>` is the path to the directory containing the P project

Check the progress of the portfolio run in file `<local-project-path>/portfolio.out` and check the output of different checker runs in `<local-project-path>/portfolio` directory.

Example:
```bash
python3 pmc.py -p ../../../Tutorial/1_ClientServer/
```
