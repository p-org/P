/*********************************************************
The AbstractBankServer provides an abstract implementation of the BankServer where it abstract away
the interaction between the BankServer and Database.
The AbstractBankServer machine is used to demonstrate how one can replace a complex component in P
with its abstraction that hides a lot of its internal complexity.
In this case, instead of storing the balance in a separate database the abstraction store the information
locally and abstracts away the complexity of bank server interaction with the database.
For the client, it still exposes the same interface/behavior. Hence, when checking the correctness
of the client it doesnt matter whether we use BankServer or the AbstractBankServer
