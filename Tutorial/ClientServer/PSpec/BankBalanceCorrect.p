/*****************************************************
This file defines two P specification monitors

- BankBalanceIsAlwaysCorrect (safety property):
BankBalanceIsCorrect checks the global invariant that the account balance communicated
to the client by the bank is always correct and there is no error on the banks side where it lost
clients money!

- GuaranteedWithDrawProgress (liveness property):
GuaranteedWithDrawProgress checks the liveness (or progress) property that all withdraw requests
submitted by the client are eventually responded.

__ Note that BankBalanceIsCorrect also checks that if there is enough money in the account then the withdraw
request must not error. Hence, the two properties above together ensure that every withdraw request
if allowed will eventually succeed and the bank cannot block legal withdraws. __

/****************************************************
BankBalanceIsAlwaysCorrect checks the global invariant that the account balance communicated
to the client by the bank is always correct and there is no error on the banks side where it lost
clients money.

For checking this property the spec machine observes the withdraw request and response events.
- On receiving the eWithDrawReq, it adds the request in the pending withdraws map so that on receiving a
response for this withdraw we can assert that the amount of money deducted from the account is same as
what was requested by the client.
- On receiving the eWithDrawResp, we look up the corresponding withdraw request and check that, the
new account balance is correct and if the withdraw failed it because the withdraw will make the account
balance go below 10 dollars which is against bank policies!
