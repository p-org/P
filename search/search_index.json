Programming these systems is challenging because of the need to reason about correctness in the presence of myriad possible interleaving of messages and failures. Unsurprisingly, it is common for service teams to uncover correctness bugs after deployment. Formal methods can play an important role in addressing this challenge!</p> <p>P Overview: P is a state machine based programming language for formally modeling and specifying complex distributed systems. P allows programmers to model their system design as a collection of communicating state machines. P supports several backend analysis engines (based on automated reasoning techniques like model checking and symbolic execution) to check that the distributed system modeled in P satisfy the desired correctness specifications.</p> <p>If you are wondering \"why do formal methods at all?\" or \"how is AWS using P to gain confidence in correctness of their services?\", the following re:Invent 2023 talk answers this question, provides an overview of P, and its impact inside AWS: (Re:Invent 2023 Talk) Gain confidence in system correctness &amp; resilience with Formal Methods (Finding Critical Bugs Early!!)</p> <p>Impact: P is currently being used extensively inside Amazon (AWS) for analysis of complex distributed systems. For example, Amazon S3 used P to formally reason about the core distributed protocols involved in its strong consistency launch. Teams across AWS are now using P for thinking and reasoning about their systems formally. P is also being used for programming safe robotics systems in Academia. P was first used to implement and validate the USB device driver stack that ships with Microsoft Windows 8 and Windows Phone.</p> <p>Experience and lessons learned: In our experience of using P inside AWS, Academia, and Microsoft. We have observed that P has helped developers in three critical ways: (1) P as a thinking tool: Writing formal specifications in P forces developers to think about their system design rigorously, and in turn helped in bridging gaps in their understanding of the system. A large fraction of the bugs can be eliminated in the process of writing specifications itself! (2) P as a bug finder: Model checking helped find corner case bugs in system design that were missed by stress and integration testing. (3) P helped boost developer velocity: After the initial overhead of creating the formal models, future updates and feature additions could be rolled out faster as these non-trivial changes are rigorously validated before implementation.</p> <p> Programming concurrent, distributed systems is fun but challenging, however, a pinch of programming language design with a dash of automated reasoning can go a long way in addressing the challenge and amplifying the fun!. </p>"},{"location":"#let-the-fun-begin","title":"Let the fun begin!","text":"<p>You can find most of the information about the P framework on this webpage: what is P?, getting started, tutorials, case studies and related research publications.

High-level protocols, though often first designed on paper using clean graphical state-machine abstractions, eventually get lost in code, and hence verification tools for such programs face the daunting task of extracting these models from the programs. The natural solution to the above problem is to build a programming language for asynchronous event-driven programs that preserves the protocol abstractions in code. Apart from the difficulty in designing such a language, this task is plagued by the reluctance of programmers to adopt a new language of programming and the discipline that it brings. However, this precise solution was pioneered by the P programming framework, where, during the development of Windows 8, the team building the USB driver stack used P for modeling, implementing, and model-checking of the USB 3.0 device drivers (paper)</p> <p>Related Blog:</p> <ul> <li>Building robust USB 3.0 support</li> <li>P: A programming language designed for asynchrony, fault-tolerance and uncertainty</li> </ul>"},{"location":"manualoutline/","title":"P Program (Outline)","text":"<p>We recommend that you start with the Tutorials to get familiar with the P language and its tool chain.</p> P Top Level Declarations Grammar <pre><code>topDecl:                # Top-level P Program Declarations\n| typeDecl              # UserDefinedTypeDeclaration\n| enumTypeDecl          # EnumTypeDeclaration\n| eventDecl             # EventDeclaration\n| machineDecl           # MachineDeclaration\n| specDecl              # SpecDeclaration\n| funDecl               # GlobalFunctionDeclaration\n| moduleDecl            # ModuleDeclaration\n| testDecl              # TestCaseDeclaration\n;\n</code></pre> <p>A P program consists of a collection of following top-level declarations:</p> Top Level Declarations Description User Defined Types P supports users defined types as well as foreign types (types that are defined in external language) Enums P supports declaring enum values that can be used as int constants (update the link) Events Events are used by state machines to communicate with each other State Machines P state machines are used to model or implement the behavior of the system Specification Monitors P specification monitors are used to write the safety and liveness specifications the system must satisfy for correctness Global Functions P supports declaring global functions that can be shared across state machines and spec monitors Module System P supports a module system for implementing and testing the system modularly by dividing it into separate components Test Cases P test cases help programmers to write different finite scenarios under which they would like to check the correctness of their system <p>Models, Specifications, Model Checking Scenario</p> <p>A quick primer on what a model is, versus a specification, and model checking scenarios: (1) A specification says what the system should do (correctness properties).

This helps ensure that your models are not doing something trivially incorrect like always doing nothing , in which case running the checker on such a model adds no value.</p> <p>For example, in the case of the client server example, the BankBalanceIsAlwaysCorrect safety property checks that the response sent by the bank server is always correct and combining it with the GuaranteedWithDrawProgress liveness property ensures that system will always eventually send a response which will be checked for correctness by the safety property.</p>"},{"location":"advanced/p2c/","title":"P2c","text":""},{"location":"advanced/p2c/#generating-c-program","title":"Generating C Program","text":"<p>P programs can be compiled to their C equivalents.

P is a state machine based programming language and hence, just like any other imperative programming language it supports basic data types, expressions, and statements that enable programmers to capture complex distributed systems protocol logic as a collection of event-handlers or functions (in P state machines).</p> <p>P State machines. The underlying model of computation for P state machines is similar to that of Gul Agha's Actor-model-of-computation (wiki). A P program is a collection of concurrently executing state machines that communicate with eachother by sending events (or messages) asynchronously. Each P state machine has an unbounded FIFO buffer associated with it. Sends are asynchronous, i.e., executing a send operation <code>send t,e,v;</code> adds event <code>e</code> with payload value <code>v</code> into the FIFO buffer of the target machine <code>t</code>. Each state in the P state machine has an entry function associated with it which gets executed when the state machine enters that state. After executing the entry function, the machine tries to dequeue an event from the input buffer or blocks if the buffer is empty. Upon dequeuing an event from the input queue of the machine, the attached handler is executed which might transition the machine to a different state. We will provide more details about the P state machines in tutorials as well as the language manual. For detailed formal semantics of P state machines, we refer the readers to the original P paper and the more recent paper with updated semantics.</p> <p>There are two main distinctions with actor model of computation: (1) P adds the syntactic sugar of state machines to actors, and (2) each state machine in P has an unbounded FIFO buffer associated with it instead of an unbounded bag in actors (semantic difference).</p> <p>[Important] Send semantics in P</p> <p>Sends are reliable, buffered, non-blocking, and directed (not broadcast). Sends are reliable i.e., executing a send operation in P adds an event into the target machines buffer. Hence, if one wants to model message loss it has to be modeled explicitly (discussed in the Failure Detector example in the tutorial). Similarly, as P state machine buffers are FIFO, events are dequeued at the state machine in the causal order in which they were sent. Note that events that are sent by two different concurrent machines will be interleaved by the checker and hence, will appear in different order at the target machine but the events sent by the same machine will always appear in the same order at the target state machine. So, just like message loss, arbitrary message re-ordering also has to be explicitly modeled in P (explained in the Paxos example in the tutorials). In general, we find that re-ordering messages/events coming from the same machine is not important and does not lead to any interesting behaviors. More interesting behaviors happen because of interleaving of messages across different state machines which the P checker explores automatically.</p> <p>Summary, by default, the communication between state machines using <code>send</code> operation follows the above semantics. If you would like to check your system correctness against an arbitrarily network then one would have to model the corresponding <code>send</code> semantics in P explicitly. One can then make the arbitrarily network behave as expected with message duplicates, loss, re-order, etc.</p> <p>If you have any further doubts related to this topic and modeling network semantics when reasoning using P, feel free to get in touch with Ankush Desai. We have several examples of such cases.</p> <p>[Important] New semantics in P</p> <p>State machines in P can be dynamically created during the execution of the Program using the <code>new</code> primitive. Creation of a state machine is also an asynchronous, non-blocking operation.</p> <p>P Monitors. Specifications in P are written as global runtime monitors. These global monitors observe the execution of the system and can assert any global safety or liveness invariants on the system. Note that the monitors are synchronously composed with the P state machines. Details are explained in the language manual and we provide examples in the tutorial.</p> <p>When reasoning about the correctness of a distributed system, it is really important to specify both safety as well as liveness specifications.</p> <p>Always specify both safety and liveness specifications</p> <p>Only specifying safety property for a system is not enough, this is mainly because, a system model may be incorrect and in the worst case drop all requests on to the ether and not perform any operation. Such a system trivially satisfies all correctness specifications! Hence, it becomes essentially to combine that safety property with liveness properties to check that the system is making progress and servicing the requests. Running the checker on models that have both safety and liveness properties ensure that for all executions explored by the checker, requests are eventually serviced by the system (by sending responses potentially) and all the responses sent by the system satisfy the desired correctness safety specification. This helps ensure that your models are not doing something trivially incorrect like always doing nothing , in which case running the checker on such a model adds no value.</p> <p>P Checker. The P Checker explores different possible behaviors of the P program arising out of: (1) concurrency: different interleavings of events from concurrently executing state machines as well as (2) data nondeterminism: different data input choices in the P program modeled using the <code>choose</code> (see) operation. The P checker explores different executions of the system that can happen because of these two forms of nondeterminism and asserts that for each of these executions the system satisfies the desired properties specified by the P Monitors.</p> <p>PObserve enables validating system correctness against formal specifications using service logs. While formal specifications help catch critical bugs during the design phase, PObserve extends this capability to implementation, testing, and production phases. By operating directly on service logs without requiring additional instrumentation, the tool allows developers to verify if their running systems satisfy the same formal correctness specifications that were validated during design. This bridges the gap between design-time specification checking and runtime behavior verification, making formal methods more accessible throughout the development lifecycle.</p>"},{"location":"advanced/structureOfPProgram/","title":"Structure of a P Program","text":"<p>A P program is typically divided into four folders (or parts):</p> <ul> <li><code>PSrc</code>: contains all the state machines representing the implementation (model) of the   system or protocol to be verified or tested.</li> <li><code>PSpec</code>: contains all the specifications representing the correctness properties that   the system must satisfy.</li> <li> <p><code>PTst</code>: contains all the environment or test harness state machines that model the   non-deterministic scenarios under which we want to check that the system model in <code>PSrc</code>   satisfies the specifications in <code>PSpec</code>.

This backend, which we call the P Verifier, allows you to prove that your systems behave correctly under all possible scenarios. The P Verifier is based on Mora et al. (OOPSLA '23) and uses UCLID5 (Polgreen et al., CAV '22).</p> <p>Before the P Verifier, P helped users catch design-level bugs early in the development process through explicit-state model checking (Brooker and Desai, Queue '25). Given a formal model, specification, and a test driver describing a system configuration, the model checking backend systematically explores the given model in search of an execution that violates the given specification for the given system configuration. See the Two-Phase Commit example tutorial for an example model, specification, and three test drivers corresponding to three different system configurations (e.g., a configuration with three participants, one coordinator, and one client). P was used in this way to help AWS migrate S3 (Simple Storage Service) from eventual to strong read-after-write consistency.</p> <p>The new verification backend allows users to prove that their system design is correct for all executions over all possible system configurations. Instead of using explicit-state model checking, the new backend supports proofs by induction. Users still provide a formal model and specification. But, instead of giving a test driver, users must provide assumptions about what is possible in the system and an inductive invariant that implies that the given model satisfies the given specification under the given assumptions. The main job of the backend is to check that that given invariant is indeed inductive (all possible events in the system preserve it) and that the given invariant does indeed imply the given specification. UCLID5 accomplishes this job by way of a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver, like Z3 (de Moura and Bj\u00f8rner, TACAS '08).</p> <p>Formal verification is important to AWS\u2019s software correctness program (Brooker and Desai, Queue '25). Several formal tools have had successful applications within AWS in their respective domains.

There is a single coordinator, who receives requests from the outside world, and a set of participants, that must agree on whether to accept or reject the request. If any participant wants to reject the request, they must all agree to reject the request; if all participants want to accept the request, then they must all agree to accept the request. The job of the coordinator is to mediate this agreement. To accomplish this, the system executes the following steps:</p> <ol> <li>The coordinator sends a message to all participants which asks the participants to vote on the request in question.</li> <li>When a participant receives this vote request message, they reply with their vote.</li> <li>When the coordinator receives a \"no\" vote---indicating that a participant wants to reject the request---it will send a message to all participants telling them to abort the request.</li> <li>Otherwise, the coordinator tallies the \"yes\" vote. If all participants have voted \"yes,\" then the coordinator sends a message to all participants telling them to commit the request.</li> <li>When a participant receives either a commit or abort message from the coordinator, it store the decision locally.</li> </ol> <p>This system is extremely easy to model in P.

The next eight invariants ensure that messages target the correct kind of machine. For example, the invariant called <code>never_req_to_coordinator</code> says that there is never a vote request message going to a coordinator. These invariants use the special predicate <code>inflight</code> which is true iff the argument message has been sent but not received. P also supports a similar predicate called <code>sent</code> which is true iff the argument message has been sent.</p> <p>After adding these invariants, we can re-run the verification engine to get the following output.</p> <pre><code>\ud83c\udf89 Verified 10 invariants!\n\u2705 one_coordinator\n\u2705 participant_set\n\u2705 never_commit_to_coordinator\n\u2705 never_abort_to_coordinator\n\u2705 never_req_to_coordinator\n\u2705 never_yes_to_participant\n\u2705 never_yes_to_init\n\u2705 never_no_to_participant\n\u2705 never_no_to_init\n\u2705 req_implies_not_init\n\u274c Failed to verify 30 properties!\n\u2753  Failed to verify invariant never_commit_to_coordinator at PSrc/System.p:13:5 \n...\n\u2753  Failed to verify invariant never_no_to_participant at PSrc/System.p:40:12 \n</code></pre> <p>What went wrong? Well, loops are tricky to reason about, so P requires users to provide loop invariants. You can think of these as summaries of what the loop does. P uses these summaries to prove other properties and checks that the loops actually abide by the given summaries. For example, we can add loop invariants to the first broadcast loop that we wrote---the one that sends out vote requests---as follows.</p> <pre><code>foreach (p in participants()) \n    invariant forall new (e: event) :: forall (m: machine) :: e targets m ==&gt; m in participants();\n    invariant forall new (e: event) :: e is eVoteReq;\n{\n    send p, eVoteReq;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>After adding similar loop invariants to all three loops in the model, we can re-run the verification engine to get the following output.</p> <pre><code>\ud83c\udf89 Verified 10 invariants!\n\u2705 one_coordinator\n\u2705 participant_set\n\u2705 never_commit_to_coordinator\n\u2705 never_abort_to_coordinator\n\u2705 never_req_to_coordinator\n\u2705 never_yes_to_participant\n\u2705 never_yes_to_init\n\u2705 never_no_to_participant\n\u2705 never_no_to_init\n\u2705 req_implies_not_init\n\u2705 default P proof obligations\n</code></pre> <p>Notice that our initial model uses <code>ignore</code> statements that we did not describe when introducing the model. If we remove these statements, the verification engine will not be able to prove that no builtin P specification is violated. In some cases, that is because the ignore statements are necessary. For example, it is possible for the coordinator to receive a \"yes\" or \"no\" vote when it is in the <code>Aborted</code> state. The <code>ignore</code> keyword lets us tell the verifier that we have thought of these cases.</p>"},{"location":"advanced/PVerifierLanguageExtensions/twophasecommitverification/#invariant-groups-proof-scripts-and-proof-caching","title":"Invariant Groups, Proof Scripts, and Proof Caching","text":"<p>When writing larger proofs, it will become useful to group invariants into lemmas, and then to tell the verifier how to use these lemmas for its proof checking.

Instead of having to execute the verifier over and over to check these builtin properties as we build our larger proofs, we want to cache these results.

But it's the implementation that gets shipped (and not design), how do we connect our design-level specifications to implementation?\"</p> <p>How to integrate checking formal specifications across all the phases of development cycle (and not just design time)?</p> <p>We mold the above mentioned challenge of integrating checking formal specifications across all the phases of development cycle as a systems observability problem:</p> <p>Improving developers' visibility into systems behavior using the lens of formal specifications. Service teams can use PObserve to observe if their system satisfies the correctness specification during design, testing, and in production.</p> <p></p> <p>PObserve is a distributed runtime monitoring framework that allows checking formal correctness specifications on systems implementation using service logs. As PObserve operates on service logs, it does not require any additional instrumentation to assert design-level correctness specification on the implementation.</p> [Architecture] How does PObserve work? <p>The figure above provides an overview of the PObserve architecture. Given a small collection of service logs (generated during integration testing or in production), PObserve requires two additional inputs (represented in orange): (1) PObserve Log Parser to parse service logs and generate PObserve events, and (2) P specifications (global invariants) that must be checked on these service logs.</p> <ul> <li>PObserve first parses the service logs to generate a sequence of time-stamped PObserve events </li> <li>Time-stamped events are then fed into a sequencer that aggregates a globally sorted stream of time-stamped events (to capture a global view of the system)</li> <li>Sorted events are then consumed by a demultiplexer that distributes the required events to each P Specification based on the events that it observes or monitors.

The key idea is that the system satisfies a liveness specification if at the end of the execution the monitor is not in a hot state (line 13). The programmers can use <code>hot</code> annotation on states to mark them as intermediate or error states. Hence, properties like <code>eventually something holds</code> or <code>every event X is eventually followed by Y</code> or <code>eventually the system enters a convergence state</code>, all such properties can be specified by marking the intermediate state as <code>hot</code> states and the checker checks that all the executions of the system eventually end in a non-hot state. If there exists an execution that fails to come out of a hot state eventually then it is flagged as a potential liveness violation.</p> <p>Details about the importance of liveness specifications is described here.

The <code>&lt;OutputDir&gt;</code> block provides the output directory for the generated code. Finally, the <code>&lt;IncludeProject&gt;</code> block provides a path to other P projects that must be included as dependencies during compilation. The P compiler simply recursively copies all the P files in the dependency projects (transitively including all P files in dependent projects) and compiles them together.

The BankServer machine uses a database machine as a service to store the bank balance for all its clients.

The <code>AbstractBankServer</code> provides an implementation of the Bank where the interaction between the BankServer and Database is abstracted away. We use the <code>AbstractBankServer</code> machine to demonstrate how one can replace a complex component in P with an abstraction that hides a lot of its internal complexity. For the client, it still exposes the same interface or behavior. Hence, when checking the correctness of the client it does not matter whether we pair it with the BankServer or the AbstractBankServer.</li> </ul> <p>Key Takeaway</p> <p>To mitigate the state space explosion problem, when modeling and checking complex systems consisting of several components, we would like to check the correctness of each component in isolation. When doing this kind of a compositional reasoning, we replace the environment of the component with its abstraction. The abstraction basically exposes the same interface as the environment but removes its internal complexity, simplifying the overall problem of checking the correctness of the component under test. There is a large body of literature on doing compositional reasoning of distributed systems. You can start with the Modular P paper.

Also, if the bank denies a withdraw request then it is only because the withdrawal would reduce the account balance to below 10.</li> <li>GuaranteedWithDrawProgress (liveness property): The GuaranteedWithDrawProgress specification checks the liveness (or progress) property that all withdraw requests submitted by the client are eventually responded.</li> </ul> <p>Stating that BankBalanceIsAlwaysCorrect checks that \"if the bank denies a withdraw request then the request would reduce the balance to below 10 (&lt; 10)\" is equivalent to state that \"if there is enough money in the account - at least 10 (&gt;= 10), then the request must not error\".

The two phase commit protocol uses a coordinator to gain consensus for any transaction spanning across multiple participants. A transaction in our case is simply a <code>write</code> operation for a key-value data store where the data store is replicated across multiple participants. More concretely, a <code>write</code> transaction must be committed by the coordinator only if it's accepted by all the participant replicas, and must be aborted if any one of the participant replicas rejects the <code>write</code> request.</p> <p></p> <p>A two phase commit protocol consists of two phases  (figure above). On receiving a write transaction, the coordinator starts the first phase in which it sends a <code>prepare</code> request to all the participants and waits for a <code>prepare success</code> or <code>prepare failure</code> response. On receiving prepare responses from all the participants, the coordinator moves to the second phase where it sends a <code>commit</code> or <code>abort</code> message to the participants and also responds back to the client.</p> <p>Assumptions: Our transaction commit system is ridiculously simplified. To list a few: (1) our system does allow multiple concurrent clients to issue transactions in parallel, but the coordinator serializes these transactions and services them one-by-one; (2) our system is not fault-tolerant to node failures, failure of either the coordinator or any of the participants will block the progress forever. Also, we rely on P's reliable send semantics to model the behavior of the underlying network, hence, our system models assume reliable delivery of messages.</p> <p>Correctness Specification: We would like our transaction commit service to provide atomicity guarantees for each transaction. That is, if the service responds to the client that a transaction was committed then that transaction must have been committed by each of its participants; and, if a transaction is aborted then at least one of the participants must have rejected it. We would also like to check that under the assumptions above (no node failures and reliable network), each transaction request is eventually responded by the transaction commit service.</p>"},{"location":"tutorial/twophasecommit/#p-project","title":"P Project","text":"<p>The 2_TwoPhaseCommit folder contains the source code for the TwoPhaseCommit project.

Ideally, we would like to check that if a transaction is committed by the coordinator then it was committed-locally by all participants, and if the transaction is aborted then at least one participant must have rejected the transaction and all the participants aborted the transaction.
